# dynamic-importmap

## Motivation

> *Import maps are an __application-level thing__... They are not meant to be composed, but instead produced by a human or tool with a __holistic view__ of your web application. For example, it would not make sense for a library to include an import map; libraries can simply reference modules by specifier, and let the application decide what URLs those specifiers map to...*
> 
> *If you load a module from a CDN that uses bare import specifiers, you'll need to know __ahead of time__ what bare import specifiers that module adds to your app, and include them in your application's import map... It's important that control of which URLs are used for each package stay with the __application author__, so they can holistically manage versioning and sharing of modules.*

While it is ideal, the luxury of having full control over the application is not always possible.
`dynamic-importmap` allows a module author to dynamically import code that contains bare import specifiers, rewriting those specifiers at runtime on the client side.

### Problem

```html
<script type="module">
  import { A } from 'https://unpkg.com/some-a';
  import { B_DependsOnA } from 'https://unpkg.com/some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a';

  // Uncaught TypeError:
  // Failed to resolve module specifier "some-a".
  // Relative references must start with either "/", "./", or "../".
</script>
```

## Solutions

### `dynamic-importmap` solution

Note that `dynamic-importmap` is meant to be a last resort (e.g., after considering the alternatives listed below).
As noted by the WICG (quoted above), import maps should ideally be defined at the application level using `<script type="importmap"/>` to ensure that common modules can be shared.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { importWithMap } from 'https://unpkg.com/dynamic-importmap@0.0.1';

  const importMap = {
    imports: {
      'some-a': 'https://unpkg.com/some-a',
      'some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a': 'https://unpkg.com/some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a',
    },
  };

  const { A } = await importWithMap('some-a', importMap);
  const { B_DependsOnA } = await importWithMap('some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a', importMap);

  // It works!
</script>
```

### ESM-aware CDN solution

An alternate solution is to use a CDN such as [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) which can perform bare import specifier rewriting on the server side.
However, this depends on a specialized CDN and prevents potentially hosting the scripts on a static web server or using a regular CDN as a fallback.

### Pre-bundling solution

Another solution would be to create a bundle for `some-b` which _contains_ a copy of `some-a`.
However, this must be done ahead of time and published to NPM as a third package.

### Pre-rewriting solution

A different solution might be to rewrite the bare module specifiers at build time (potentially in some new package `some-b-with-full-import-specifiers-for-a`).
However this locks you in to a particular CDN, which makes redundancy difficult and may have security implications.

### es-module-shims solution

[es-module-shims](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims) can be used in shim-mode (rather than polyfill-mode) to achieve the same result as `dynamic-importmap`.

<details>
<summary>Toggle code</summary>

```js
window.esmsInitOptions = {
  shimMode: true,
  mapOverrides: true,
};

const script = Object.assign(document.createElement('script'), {
  type: 'importmap-shim',
  innerHTML: JSON.stringify({
    imports: {
      'some-a': 'https://unpkg.com/some-a',
      'some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a': 'https://unpkg.com/some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a',
    }
  }),
});

document.body.appendChild(script);

await import('https://ga.jspm.io/npm:es-module-shims@1.6.1/dist/es-module-shims.js');

const { A } = await importShim('some-a');
const { B_DependsOnA } = await importShim('some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a');
```

</details>

However, this usage of `es-module-shims` is not well documented, involves some undesired use of side-effects and global variables, and involves importing unused code (i.e., the feature detection and error handling code necessary for its polyfill-mode).

`dynamic-importmap` simply re-packages much of the `es-module-shims` internals into a straightforward one-function API that does not include the polyfill-related code.

### Take control over the full application ðŸ’ª

### UMD solution

Just kidding :laughing:


## React example

A common practice is to publish a React component library to NPM as ESM in which `react` and `react-dom` have been "externalized" and kept as bare import specifiers.
Using `dynamic-importmap`, this component library can be dynamically imported from a regular CDN (e.g., [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)), without having full control over the importmaps on the page.
For example, such a React component library might need to be imported into an ES module that will run in a Jupyter notebook with [anywidget](https://github.com/manzt/anywidget).

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script type="module">
  import { importWithMap } from 'https://unpkg.com/dynamic-importmap@0.0.1';

  const importMap = {
    imports: {
      "react": "https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0?dev",
      "react-dom": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0?dev",
      "react-dom/client": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0/client?dev",
      "prop-types": "https://esm.sh/prop-types@15.8.1?dev",
      "react-feather": "https://unpkg.com/react-feather@2.0.10/dist/index.js"
    },
  };

  const React = await importWithMap("react", importMap);
  const { createRoot } = await importWithMap("react-dom/client", importMap);

  // react-feather is a React icon library
  // which contains bare import specifiers for "react" and "prop-types"
  const { Smile } = await importWithMap('react-feather', importMap);

  function MyApp(props) {
    return React.createElement(React.Suspense,
      { fallback: React.createElement('div', {}, 'Loading...') },
      React.createElement(Smile),
    );
  }

  const domContainer = document.getElementById('root');
  const root = createRoot(domContainer);
  root.render(React.createElement(MyApp));
</script>
```
