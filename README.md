## Motivation

> *Import maps are an __application-level thing__... They are not meant to be composed, but instead produced by a human or tool with a __holistic view__ of your web application. For example, it would not make sense for a library to include an import map; libraries can simply reference modules by specifier, and let the application decide what URLs those specifiers map to...*
> 
> *If you load a module from a CDN that uses bare import specifiers, you'll need to know __ahead of time__ what bare import specifiers that module adds to your app, and include them in your application's import map... It's important that control of which URLs are used for each package stay with the __application author__, so they can holistically manage versioning and sharing of modules.*<br/>

While it is ideal, the luxury of having full control over the application is not always possible.
`dynamic-importmap` allows a module author to dynamically import code that contains bare import specifiers, rewriting those specifiers at runtime on the client side.

### Problem

```html
<script type="module">
  import { A } from 'https://unpkg.com/some-a';
  import { B_DependsOnA } from 'https://unpkg.com/some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a';

  // Uncaught TypeError:
  // Failed to resolve module specifier "some-a".
  // Relative references must start with either "/", "./", or "../".
</script>
```

### `dynamic-importmap` solution

```html
<script type="module">
  import { importWithMap } from 'https://unpkg.com/dynamic-importmap@0.0.1';

  const importMap = {
    imports: {
      'some-a': 'https://unpkg.com/some-a',
      'some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a': 'https://unpkg.com/some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a',
    },
  };

  const { A } = await importWithMap('some-a', importMap);
  const { B_DependsOnA } = await importWithMap('some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a', importMap);

  // It works!
</script>
```

Note that `dynamic-importmap` is meant to be a last resort (e.g., after considering the alternative solutions below).
As noted by the WICG (quoted above), import maps should ideally be defined at the application level using `<script type="importmap"/>` to ensure that common modules can be shared.

## Alternative solutions

### ESM-aware CDN solution

An alternate solution is to use a CDN such as [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) which can perform bare import specifier rewriting on the server side.
However, this depends on a specialized CDN (over which you have no control, of performance or otherwise) and prevents potentially hosting the scripts on a static web server or using a regular CDN as a fallback.


### Pre-bundling solution

Another solution would be to create a bundle for `some-b` which _contains_ a copy of `some-a`.
However, this must be done at build time and published to NPM as a third joint package.
This also requires fixing the version of `some-a` that is included at build time, and would prevent usage of a different version or variant (e.g., for production vs. development).
Pre-bundling also does not allow taking advantage of CDN benefits such as the user browser cache already having a copy.

### Pre-rewriting solution

A different solution might be to rewrite the bare import specifiers into full specifiers at build time.
However, this couples the package to a particular CDN, which makes redundancy difficult and may have security implications.
Similar to the above pre-bundling solution, it also locks in the version/variant of `some-a` that is used (i.e., in the full specifier).

### es-module-shims solution

[es-module-shims](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims) can be used in shim-mode (rather than polyfill-mode) to achieve the same result as `dynamic-importmap`.

<details>
<summary>Toggle code</summary>

```js
window.esmsInitOptions = {
  shimMode: true,
  mapOverrides: true,
};

const script = Object.assign(document.createElement('script'), {
  type: 'importmap-shim',
  innerHTML: JSON.stringify({
    imports: {
      'some-a': 'https://unpkg.com/some-a',
      'some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a': 'https://unpkg.com/some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a',
    }
  }),
});

document.body.appendChild(script);

await import('https://ga.jspm.io/npm:es-module-shims@1.6.1/dist/es-module-shims.js');

const { A } = await importShim('some-a');
const { B_DependsOnA } = await importShim('some-b-with-bare-import-specifiers-for-a');
```

</details>

However, this usage of `es-module-shims` involves some undesired use of side-effects and global variables, and involves importing unused code (i.e., the feature detection and error handling code necessary for its polyfill-mode).

`dynamic-importmap` simply re-packages much of the `es-module-shims` internals into a straightforward one-function API that does not include the polyfill-related code.

### Take control over the full application ðŸ’ª

### UMD solution

Just kidding :laughing:


## React example

A common practice is to publish a React component library to NPM as ESM in which `react` and `react-dom` have been "externalized" and kept as bare import specifiers.
Using `dynamic-importmap`, this component library can be dynamically imported from a regular CDN (e.g., [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)), without having full control over the importmaps on the page.
For example, such a React component library might need to be imported into an ES module that will run in a Jupyter notebook with [anywidget](https://github.com/manzt/anywidget), an R [htmlwidget](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/develop_intro.html#javascript-binding), or an [Observable notebook cell](https://observablehq.com/@keller-mark/dynamic-importmap-demo).

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script type="module">
  import { importWithMap } from 'https://unpkg.com/dynamic-importmap@0.0.1';

  const importMap = {
    imports: {
      "react": "https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0?dev",
      "react-dom": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0?dev",
      "react-dom/client": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0/client?dev",
      "prop-types": "https://esm.sh/prop-types@15.8.1?dev",
      "react-feather": "https://unpkg.com/react-feather@2.0.10/dist/index.js"
    },
  };

  const React = await importWithMap("react", importMap);
  const { createRoot } = await importWithMap("react-dom/client", importMap);

  // react-feather is a React icon library
  // which contains bare import specifiers for "react" and "prop-types"
  const { Smile } = await importWithMap('react-feather', importMap);

  function MyApp(props) {
    return React.createElement(React.Suspense,
      { fallback: React.createElement('div', {}, 'Loading...') },
      React.createElement(Smile),
    );
  }

  const domContainer = document.getElementById('root');
  const root = createRoot(domContainer);
  root.render(React.createElement(MyApp));
</script>
```
